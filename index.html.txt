    <h2>Family Background</h2>
    <p>
      Family is very important to me. I'm the youngest of five siblingsâ€”three older brothers and one older sister.
      I'm blessed to have three adorable nephews and three lovely sisters-in-law. My parents are my pillars of strength,
      always showering me with love and support. I cherish the time I spend with them and enjoy playing with my nephews.
      One of our favorite activities is walking barefoot to the street to buy candies, creating sweet memories together.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My educational journey started at Villa Milagrosa Elementary School, where I graduated at the age of 11.
      Those were some of the happiest days of my life, filled with laughter, friendships, and fun-filled moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In senior high school, I chose Tailoring as my strand because I genuinely enjoyed sewing and creating things.
      One of the highlights of my senior year was our JS Prom, where I was crowned <strong>Prom Queen</strong>.
      It was an unforgettable night, dancing with friends and being surrounded by loved ones who were beaming with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated high school at the age of 17 from Mayor Inocencio B. Mendez. Now, I'm excited to take on new challenges
      in college, balancing academics and personal growth. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds and making
      the most of every opportunity that comes my way.
